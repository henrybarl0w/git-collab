            <p>Deep learning, a pivotal branch of artificial intelligence, has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.</p>
            <p>In 2012, AlexNet's decisive victory in the ImageNet competition dramatically reduced image classification error rates, marking a breakthrough in visual deep learning. This milestone not only established the foundation for visual perception systems in autonomous driving but also enabled automated diagnosis in medical imaging.</p>
            <p>In 2014, the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) empowered AI to generate visual content for the first time. These innovations have revolutionized productivity tools across creative industries, from digital art to product design.</p>
            <p>In 2016, AlphaGo defeated Go world champion Lee Sedol, demonstrating deep learning’s superior performance in complex decision-making. This achievement has since catalyzed efficiency gains in fields such as new materials development and logistics optimization.</p>
            <p>In 2017, the emergence of the Transformer architecture laid the groundwork for transformative progress in natural language processing. Google’s BERT model significantly advanced machine reading comprehension to near-human levels, greatly enhancing search engine accuracy and information retrieval efficiency.</p>
            <p>Since 2018, deep learning has made significant contributions to the medical field: early cancer detection now exceeds the diagnostic accuracy of expert radiologists in certain tasks; drug discovery timelines have been shortened through AI-driven molecular simulation; and the long-standing challenge of protein structure prediction has been effectively addressed by AlphaFold.</p>

            <p>In 2020, GPT-3 demonstrated unprecedented language generation capabilities, producing coherent texts, writing simple code, and engaging in creative composition. These developments signal the beginning of automation in knowledge-intensive work.</p>
            <p>In 2022, text-to-image models such as DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion emerged, lowering the barrier to creative expression to an unprecedented degree. Artistic creation has thus evolved from a specialized skill into a capability accessible to the general public.</p>
            <p>AI is now capable of scripting, generating illustrations and diagrams, and even producing multilingual talk show videos. Artificial intelligence is progressively transforming every facet of society. While its ultimate trajectory remains uncertain, one thing is clear: it will continue advancing at an accelerating pace.</p>
