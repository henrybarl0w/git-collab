    <h1>Climate Modelling</h1>

    <p>Climate modelling is the result of essential computations that benefits society greatly.<br>It allows for weather forecasts and informed government planning.</p>
   
    <p>It starts by collecting data inputs from various sources, such as satellites and weather stations.<br>Raw data gathered is consolidated for processing.</p>
    
    <p>During processing, data is cleaned - removing errors and amending any missing data if necessary.<br>Data may also need to be changed - data formats and the size of the data itself, so that it may be processing.</p>
   
    <p>High performance computers run complex mathematical models using gathered data to produce simulations and predictions.</p>
   
    <p>Outputs of large data sets can be analysed using statistical analysis tools to identify trends and possible hazards.</p>

    <p>Processed data is used to generate visualisations of the data - such as graphs, animations and weather maps.<br>This can then be used by meteorologists to interpret data easily and produce reports.</p>

    <p>Through this process, weather trends can easily be identified, to inform society on the weather forecast,<br>and unknown hazards can be discovered, to give governments the necessary information to act accordingly and potentially save lives.</p>
