# REVIEW
## Interesting Content
 - very interesting
 - no refrences for images
 - lovely rounded corners
 - images a bit too small to see properly
 - Deep Learning layout is nice

## Consistency
 - lets be realistic did any of us actually make any attempt at visual coherence though??!?

## Quality of Written Content
 - There is content
 - lovely quote I guess

## Validity of HTML
 - Deeplearning.html contains an unclosed \<i> tag making the whole page italic
 - need to move the active class on nav bar
 - I didn't even know footer was a real tag sooo good job 👍

## Collaboration
 - there is author info
 - everyone made a page
 - equivalent effort
